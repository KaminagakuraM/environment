## Environment Configuration

This repository offers a streamlined setup for a few software applications \
I've been using, including personalized dotfiles. I designed these with ease of \
installation and customization in mind, ensuring code in said dotfiles are \
easily referenced in their respective documentation.

I created this repo ensuring it meets my own workflow needs and preferences. \
I encourage you to customize this configuration to better fit your individual \
style and requirements

#### Installation Instructions

For detailed installation instructions tailored to each application, please \
refer to their subdirectories:

- [Nvim](./nvim/)
- [Tmux](./tmux/)
- [Alacritty](./alacritty/)
- [Aerospace](./aerospace/)

#### Closing Remarks

While I aimed to adhere closely to the documentation of these programs, I have \
made significant modifications to them, drawing inspiration from configurations \
created by others as well as implementing my own "enhancements".

Here are some of the configuration files from which I constantly referenced from, \
and even included in my personal work environment:

- [89iuv's Catppuccin Tmux theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/tmux/discussions/317?sort=top)
- [Kickstart Nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- [Josean Martinez](https://www.josean.com/posts/tmux-setup)
