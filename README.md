## Environment Configuration

---

Instructions for properly installing `.config` files for each program can be \
found in their respective subfolders:

- [Nvim](./nvim/)
- [Tmux](./tmux/)
- [Alacritty](./alacritty/)
- [Aerospace](./aerospace/)

I'm currently preparing to push various other configurations.
