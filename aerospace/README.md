#### Aerospace Installation

- Install Aerospace using your prefered method, I use brew in this config:

  - `brew install --cask aerospace`

- Open Aerospace to create initialization files.

- Move `aerospace.toml` into your computer's `~/.config/aerospace` folder. You \
  can create said folder if it was not automatically created when opening Aerospace.

- Reload Aerospace config or quit and reopen the app for changes to take effect.
