#### Nvim

- install nvim
  - `brew install neovim`
- download these required packages to your system using `brew install`:
  - `node`, `npm`, `ripgrep`, `pngpaste`, `luarocks`, `fd`
- copy the `nvim` repo folder into your `/.config` folder

#### Important

- copilot and copilot-cpm are installed in this configuration. Make sure to \
  run `:Copilot auth` to link your account; otherwise, remove both copilot \
  plugins and all copilot mentions throghout the config files (this is going \
  to be easy with telescope)
